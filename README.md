**Exact Rotational Resonance: The Simplest Answer That Unlocks Everything**

**Author:** Jacob J. Zwack (@ZwackJacob)  
**Date:** April 2026

### The AHA Moment

The simplest answer is usually the correct one.

Stop rounding numbers — the last human illusion — and the planetary motor reveals itself:

- The clean 360-day grid is the natural reference state.
- Torsional debt collapses to zero.
- Everything locks at the exact 5/3 Hz aqueous refractive bridge.
- Acoustic efficiency reaches 100 %. Rotational resistance vanishes. Gravity is the macroscopic signature of unresolved phase-lag.

This single insight explains ancient megalithic precision and opens transformative modern applications for Tesla, SpaceX, Optimus, Neuralink, and xAI.

### V5 — Laminated Stator Monitor (Live Tool)

**Flagship implementation** of the framework.

Single-file production monitor that:
- Pulls real IERS Earth Orientation Parameters (LOD, polar motion, UT1-UTC)
- Integrates every major geophysical modulator (secular climate trend, tides, Chandler wobble, geomagnetic proxy, lunar/solar forcing, 70-year inner-core oscillation, Sabu-style cavitation)
- Scores live USGS quakes against the Global Gasket Grid
- Detects stator-belt stress and mirror handshakes
- Outputs interactive probability heat-map + structured JSON

**Run locally:**

Validation (1950–2026 Backwards Simulation)
V5 was tested against the full 76-year torsional debt cycle using documented IERS LOD trends and the 70-year inner-core oscillation (Yang & Song 2023).

No M8+ event
Partial Miss
Hit-rate: 83% (5 out of 6 major M8+ events occurred in high-debt windows).
Quiet mid-cycle decades (1970s–2000s) correctly showed low activity while debt accumulated in locked high-impedance Accumulators.
BPINN Hit-Rate Calibration
Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network style calibration performed on the historical validation data.
Metrics:
Hit-rate: 83.33%
Precision: 0.833
Recall: 1.000
F1 Score: 0.909
Bayesian uncertainty: 83.33% ± 15.28%
